# 7. Serial Communication Course

## 7.1 Principles of Master-Slave Device Communication

This section provides a detailed overview of the master-slave relationship in xArm AI's communication with various devices, including STM32, 51 microcontrollers, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi. It explains how xArm AI functions as a slave device and how other devices act as masters to control it.

Throughout this chapter, xArm AI operates as a slave device, exchanging information with other devices via UART serial communication.

### 7.1.1 Master-Slave Relationship

In a master-slave control system, xArm AI operates as the slave device, while other microcontrollers, such as STM32 or Arduino, function as the master.

* **Functions of xArm AI as a Slave**

(1) Receiving and Parsing Signals from the Master

xArm AI listens for serial signals. When data is received via UART, it parses the data according to the communication protocol and executes the corresponding functions based on the received instructions.

(2) Executing Commands Based on Received Data

Once the signal is parsed, xArm AI performs the appropriate actions, such as executing motion sequences or controlling servos.

(3) Data Packaging and Response

When a read command is received, xArm AI retrieves the requested data, packages it according to the communication protocol, and transmits it back to the master device.

* **Other Devices as the Master**

(1) Command Packaging and Transmission

The master device must package control commands and data into a structured data packet according to the communication protocol before sending them to xArm AI.

(2) Control and Coordination

The master device is responsible for managing system-wide coordination, ensuring seamless communication and operation between xArm AI and other devices while avoiding conflicts.

(3) Data Reception

When retrieving xArm AI's status, the master device must receive the response after sending a read command. It should verify the integrity and accuracy of the received data, then parse the data packet to extract useful information.

### 7.1.2 Hardware Connection

Example: Connecting xArm AI to a PC
Connect the TXD, RXD, and GND pins of the USB adapter to the RX, TX, and GND pins on the controller using DuPont wires. Then, plug the USB adapter into the computer to establish the connection.

The power supply for the master device and xArm AI can be different, but they must share a common ground to ensure stable communication levels.

### 7.1.3 Data Transmission Format

The default UART serial data transmission format for xArm AI is:

| **Parameter** | **Value** |
| :-----------: | :-------: |
|   Baud rate   |   9600    |
|   Data bit    |     8     |
|  Parity bit   |   None    |
|   Stop bit    |     1     |

### 7.1.4 Communication Protocol

The command packet consists of the following fields:

| **Header** | **Data Length** | **Command** | **Parameters** |
| :--------: | :-------------: | :---------: | :------------: |
| 0x55 0x55  |     Length      |     Cmd     | Prm 1 ~ Prm N  |

(1) Header: Two consecutive bytes of 0x55 indicate the start of a data packet.

(2) Data Length: This field represents the total length of the packet excluding the header. It is calculated as:
**Length = Number of Parameters (N) + 2**
(The additional 2 bytes account for the command and the data length field itself.)

(3) Command: A byte that specifies the control operation to be executed.

(4) Parameters: Additional control information required by the command.

## 7.2 PC Serial Port Control

### 7.2.1 Implementation Principles

(1) After connecting xArm AI to a PC via a TTL serial interface for serial communication, xArm AI is controlled through the serial port, and its default UART data transmission format is:

| Baud rate  | 9600 |
| :--------: | :--: |
|  Data bit  |  8   |
| Parity bit | None |
|  Stop bit  |  1   |

Communication protocol:

Below, we explain the format of the protocol command packet. The format is as follows:

|  Header   | Data Length | Command |  Parameters   |
| :-------: | :---------: | :-----: | :-----------: |
| 0x55 0x55 |   Length    |   Cmd   | Prm 1 ~ Prm N |

Header: Two consecutive bytes of 0x55 indicate the start of a data packet.

Data Length: This field represents the total length of the packet excluding the header. It is calculated as:  

**Length = Number of Parameters (N) + 2**  

(The additional 2 bytes account for the command and the data length field itself.)

Command: A byte that specifies the control operation to be executed.

Parameters: Additional control information required by the command.

### 7.2.2 Preparation

* **Hardware Preparation**

Connect the TXD, RXD, and GND pins of the USB adapter to the RX, TX, and GND pins on the controller using DuPont wires. Then, plug the USB adapter into the computer to establish the connection.
